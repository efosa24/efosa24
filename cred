The team conducted a comprehensive review of the December 2024 Global Complaint Oversight Metrics Dashboard. Overall, Global Complaint Oversight Metrics successfully met their targets for all metrics except for Triage Timeliness, which indicated a "yellow" status. Complaint volumes in December 2024 showed an increase compared to the previous month. Key metrics, including Complaint Timeliness, MFT Timeliness, Change Log Timeliness, Trending Report Timeliness, and MDR Submission Timeliness, indicated a "green" status, while Triage Timeliness indicated "yellow."

A deeper review revealed that Complaint Timeliness, MFT Timeliness, and Change Log Timeliness have been "green" over the past three months for all regions. Triage Timeliness has been "green" for the past three months in LATAM and NA regions. For the APAC region, Triage Timeliness was "green" for October and November 2024 but flagged as "red" in December 2024. A member of the APAC team noted that “there was a significantly increasing number of counterfeit complaints (3–4 times higher volumes), samples collected during 4Q’ 2024 from China GBP market sweep activities. Typically, these complaints would be managed through the MFT process. However, due to alert limits and the upper control limit (UCL) being reached as a result of repeated GBP counterfeit complaints logged for the same product and batch, PQMS processed as ‘System Open,’ reducing the triage timeline from ten days to two days. Most of the late complaints were processed on day three.”

“Additionally, a contributing factor in China is the overall increase in system open complaints for Band-Aid Brand products due to a change in local MD reportability requirements, resulting in a high number of potentially reportable cases that are given priority by the responsible triage analysts. A review of the caseload and responsibilities of the China analysts will be conducted, with realignment to be implemented as required. Discussions with China GBP are ongoing to ensure appropriate CV resource is available for planned market activity/surge in complaint numbers.”

For the EMEA region, Triage Timeliness was "yellow" in October 2024, "green" in November 2024, but indicated "yellow" again in December 2024. An EMEA team member noted that this is a result of a high volume of GBP cases. Alignment with GBP to prioritize normal cases and address GBP cases is planned for January. Increased complaints due to marketing activities, especially for Listerine, Aveeno, Neutrogena, and business closures during the Christmas holidays, were also contributing factors.

The review further revealed that complaint volumes across all regions and globally were higher than in the previous month. The Word Cloud analysis highlighted commonly used terms in complaint descriptions for December 2024 for the top eight products in respective regions.

EMEA and APAC regions experienced an increase in Triage volumes in December 2024 compared to the previous month, while LATAM and NA saw a decrease. Change Log volumes showed a slight decrease globally.

The team also reviewed Open Overdue complaints in Tableau, focusing on cases aged 46–75 days, 76–104 days, and 105–365 days for the respective regions.

In conclusion, the meeting was highly successful, reflecting strong Regional and Global complaint vigilance performance throughout December 2024.
