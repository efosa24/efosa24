The team conducted a comprehensive review of the December 2024 Global Complaint Oversight Metrics Dashboard. Overall, Global Complaint Oversight Metrics successfully met their targets for all metrics except for Triage Timeliness which indicate yellow. The complaint volumes in December 2024 showing an increase over the previous month. Key metrics, including Complaint Timeliness, MFT Timeliness, Change Log Timeliness, Trending Report Timeliness, and MDR Submission Timeliness, indicated a "green" status while Triage Timeliness indicted yellow.
A deeper review of Complaint Timeliness MFT Timeliness and Change Log Timeliness are all green in the past three months for all regions. Triage Timeliness is green for the past three months for LATAM and NA regions. For APAC region, Triage Timeliness is green for the past two month but red in December 2024. A member of the APAC team noted that “there was a significantly increasing number of counterfeit complaints (3-4 times higher volumes), samples collected during 4Q’ 2024 from China GBP market sweep activities. Typically, these complaints would be managed through the MFT process. However, due to alert limits and the upper control limit (UCL) being reached as a result of repeated GBP counterfeit complaints logged for the same product & batch, PQMS processed as ‘System Open,’ reducing the triage timeline from ten days to two days. Most of the late complaints were processed on day three”.
“Additionally, a contributing factor in China is the overall increase in system open complaints for Band-Aid Brand products due to a change in local MD reportability requirements, resulting in a high number of potentially reportable cases that are given priority by the responsible triage analysts. A review of the case load and responsibilities of the China analysts will be conducted, with realignment to be implemented as required. Discussions with China GBP are on-going to ensure appropriate CV resource is available for planned market activity/ surge in complaint numbers”.
For EMEA region, Triage Timeliness was yellow in October 2024 and green in November 2024 but indicated yellow in December 2024. An EMEA team member noted that this is as a result of High amount of GBP cases: Alignment with GBP to prioritize normal cases and take care of the GBP cases in January, increased complaints due to marketing activities especially for: Listerine, Aveeno, Neutrogena and business closed/ vacation as of Christmas holidays.
