1.	Calculate “Time in Step” by checking the difference between “Process Step Start Date” and “Process Step End Date” rounding up the two columns.
2.	
a.	Calculate “Device” Check if Reg class column has Device and Device II, the return Device otherwise return non-device.
b.	Calculate “Late Device”: 

 By checking if Device = Device and “Time in step” is greater than 8, the return Late otherwise return Not Late

3.	Calculate “Serious” to determine the cases that priority or non-priority.
If Seriousness =Priority or Serious AE then return “Priority” otherwise return “Non-priority”.
a.	Calculate “Late Priority”, If Device = Device and Serious = Priority, then Time in Step greater than 2 then return Late otherwise not late.
b.	Calculate “Late Non-Priority” if Device = Device, Priority = Non-Priority or Owner group = Forte Washington, Lancaster, Las Piedras, McNeil EM Investigator, McNeil US OTC Home Office and Time in Step greater than 4 return Late, otherwise Not Late
4.	Late 10 Days
If Time in step is greater than 10 then return Late, otherwise return Not Late

5.	Late= Final Column to determine cases that are Late
If Device = Late, Late Priority = Late, Late Non-Priority = Late, Last in 10 Days = Late, then return Late otherwise return Not late.
