The team conducted a comprehensive review of the September 2024 Global Complaint Oversight Metrics Dashboard. Overall, all Global Complaint Oversight Metrics successfully met their targets, with complaint volumes in September 2024 showing an increase over the previous month. Key metrics, including Complaint Timeliness, MFT Timeliness, Triage Timeliness, Change Log Timeliness, Trending Report Timeliness, and MDR Submission Timeliness, all indicated a "green" status.

A deeper review of Complaint Timeliness and Change Log Timeliness over the past three months showed consistent "green" performance across all regions, meeting established goals. For MFT Timeliness and Change Log Timeliness, all regions maintained green ratings, with EMEA returning to green in September after a red status in August.

Triage Timeliness was also evaluated, with APAC, LATAM, and EMEA regions maintaining green for the last three months; however, EMEA’s yellow status for Triage Timeliness over this period necessitates a corrective action. An EMEA team member noted that resource constraints—due to vacations, medical leave, and increased triage volume—were contributing factors.

The review further revealed that complaint volumes across all regions and globally were higher than in the previous month. The WordCloud analysis highlighted commonly used terms in complaint descriptions for September 2024, while the complaint distribution by category indicated that Non-Priority issues were a significant driver of complaint volume.

Triage and MFT volumes increased globally and across all regions compared to August, while the change log volume showed a decline for LATAM, EMEA, and NA but a slight increase for APAC. Analysis of the change log distribution suggested that the high volume of Adverse Event cases significantly contributed to overall volume.

The team also reviewed Open Overdue complaints in Tableau, focusing on cases aged 46–75 days, 76–104 days, and 105–365 days within the NA and EMEA regions. The CV team Director emphasized the need to establish clear reasons for any cases that remain open and overdue without an extension prior to each oversight meeting.

In conclusion, the meeting was highly successful, reflecting strong Regional and Global complaint vigilance performance throughout September 2024.
