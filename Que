April 2025 Global Complaint Oversight Metrics Review Summary

The team conducted a comprehensive review of the April 2025 Global Complaint Oversight Metrics Dashboard. Overall, global metrics successfully met all targets, reflecting a green status across the board.

At the regional level, APAC, LATAM, and NA met their goals for all metrics, each achieving green status. The EMEA region also demonstrated strong performance, achieving green status for all metrics except Triage Timeliness, which was rated yellow.

A focused analysis of EMEA’s late triage cases revealed that all 18 late cases were classified as ‘priority’, which require closure within 2 business days. Notably, 4 of these cases were related to GBP, which a regional representative attributed to the high volume of GBP-driven complaints.

Trend analysis showed that Complaint Timeliness, MFT Timeliness, and Change Log Timeliness remained green for APAC, LATAM, and NA over the past three months. For EMEA:

Complaint Timeliness was yellow in February, but green in March and April.

MFT and Change Log Timeliness remained green consistently.

Triage Timeliness was green in February, but dropped to yellow in March and April.

The team also reviewed the Complaint Oversight Dashboard, including the Summary, GCV, and End-to-End views. Analysts were reminded to proactively close cases before they approach the 45-day threshold to prevent overdue status.

Conclusion:
The meeting concluded on a positive note, highlighting strong global and regional complaint oversight performance for April 2025, with continuous improvement focus in EMEA Triage Timeliness.
