Meeting Summary: Global Complaint Oversight Metrics Review (March and February 2025)

The meeting commenced with a discussion on excluding GBP cases from the oversight metric calculations. The team reached a consensus that GBP cases should be excluded from the metric calculations moving forward.

March 2025 Oversight Metrics Review
The team conducted a comprehensive review of the March 2025 Global Complaint Oversight Metrics Dashboard (GCV). Overall, the Global Complaint Oversight Metrics achieved all performance targets.

At the regional level:

APAC, LATAM, and NA achieved “green” status across all metrics.

EMEA showed “green” performance for all metrics except Triage Timeliness, which was marked as “yellow.” The EMEA team attributed this to the influence of GBP cases within the region.

Further analysis of late triage cases, including a review of the ‘Time in Step’ interval, indicated that the delays were predominantly driven by priority cases, which are expected to close within two business days.

The team also reviewed the End-to-End Global Complaint Oversight Metrics, noting that all targets were met, except for Complaint Aging, which was in “yellow” status. This deviation was attributed to a case entered into PQMS beyond the 45-day threshold.

A review of the past three months showed:

APAC maintained “green” status across all metrics except Triage Timeliness in January 2025.

LATAM and NA remained “green” across all metrics for the entire period.

EMEA experienced fluctuating Triage Timeliness status: “yellow” in January, “green” in February, and back to “yellow” in March. Complaint Timeliness in EMEA was “green” in January, “yellow” in February, and returned to “green” in March. MFT and Change Log metrics remained consistently “green” over the three months.

In line with standard procedures, no further action is required at this time.

The team also reviewed the Complaint Open Overdue Cases using the oversight metrics dashboard to monitor and evaluate trends.

Conclusion: The meeting highlighted strong global and regional performance in March 2025, underscoring continued vigilance in complaint oversight.

February 2025 Oversight Metrics Review
A similar review was conducted for the February 2025 Global Complaint Oversight Metrics Dashboard. All metrics met performance targets, with the exception of Complaint Aging Overdue, which was marked “yellow.”

An increase in complaint volume was observed in December 2024 compared to the prior month. Despite this, key metrics such as Complaint Timeliness, MFT Timeliness, Change Log Timeliness, Complaint Aging, Trending Report Timeliness, and MDR Submission Timeliness remained in “green” status.

A regional breakdown revealed:

NA and LATAM consistently achieved “green” status across Complaint Timeliness, MFT Timeliness, and Change Log Timeliness for the past three months.

APAC was “green” for all metrics in February, with Triage Timeliness having been “red” in December 2024 and January 2025.

EMEA showed “yellow” status for Complaint Timeliness in February, while MFT and Change Log Timeliness remained “green.” Triage Timeliness improved from “yellow” in December and January to “green” in February.

The team noted that global complaint volumes in February 2025 were higher than in the previous month. Additionally, a Word Cloud analysis highlighted common terms from complaint descriptions for the top eight products by region, offering insights into recurring issues and areas for further investigation.

Conclusion: The February 2025 review also reflected strong performance across regions, with the team maintaining a proactive and data-driven approach to complaint oversight.
